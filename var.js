let a=3;
var s=4;
const d=9;


console.log(a);
console.log(s);
console.log(d);



let f;

console.log(f);



let name=ved;

console.log(name)



// we can not use "name " as variable name because name is a existing property on window , that behaves a little different from normal variables. 



// camel case is basically known as more efficient way to gave name of variables.
